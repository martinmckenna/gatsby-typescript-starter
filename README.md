## Quick Info

Here's some hot facts about this project:

1. This project uses TypeScript, which allows you to declare all your files with both `.ts` and `.tsx` file types.

2. This project comes with an out-of-the-box [`tsconfig.json`](./tsconfig.json) and [`tslint.json`](./tslint.json)

3. This project includes a TypeScript prettier config

4. Absolute imports are allowed by default

    * for example, `import { blah } from src/utils/hello` works just fine.

5. This project comes with [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), which allows for doing stuff on pre-commit, pre-push, etc. Check out the [`package.json`](./package.json) to see the already configured pre-commit. Currently, it lints and type checks before committing.
